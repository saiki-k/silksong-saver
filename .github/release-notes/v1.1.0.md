## Improvements

-   **Configuration file naming**: Executables now ship with a `config` file instead of `.env` for better visibility and clearer identification. This avoids confusion with dotfiles being hidden on macOS/Linux systems (backward compatible with `.env`)

## Documentation Improvements

-   Updated README to clarify `config` file usage for executables vs `.env` for source

## Internal Changes

-   Configuration loader now supports both `.env` and `config` files with automatic fallback
