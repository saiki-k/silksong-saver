## What's New

-   **Custom modal dialogs**: Replaced native browser `confirm()` and `prompt()` dialogs with custom modal system for cross-browser compatibility, particularly for Steam browser where `prompt()` is not supported

## Fixes

-   Include modal.js in executable build assets to ensure custom dialogs work in the standalone application
-   Add default text for the cancel (and confirm) button(s) in custom modal dialogs
